# Digital_SpiritLevel

This project is a Digital SpiritLevel made with STM32 an ARM based Microcontroller. I have specifically made this project for those who have just started their ARM's journey. For this project I have chosen the STM32G0 microcontroller but you can do this project with any STM hardware as it uses HAL libraries which are very portable and beginner friendly.

In this project you will learn about ARM's microcontroller, STM's microarchitecture, Inertial measurement unit, SSD1306 Oled Display driver, Sensor data fusion performed in IMU and many more things. I would reccommend you to use this repository only as a guide and try to do this project by yourself.

This is how my project looks I have completely built it on breadboard without any dev board, it uses STM32G030F6P6TR barechip TSSOP20 package with a breakout board only. Main purpose of choosing this approach is to make sure you get good hardware exposure as well however if you are not comfortable with barechip you can use some other dev board like STM32 BluePill, STM32 BlackPill or something similar.
